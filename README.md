# Checkout-Application
C++ User Input Checkout Form | 
This program gets user input for name, email, number of products purchased, and product ID's. 
Then it sets a customerID for each customer, calculates the subtotal for each productID entered, and sorts the productID. 
It determines whether they qualify for free shipping and which discount level,
then calculates the total. This is all written to CheckoutData.txt.
